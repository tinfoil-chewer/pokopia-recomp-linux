// Dear ImGui overlay on the Vulkan path (S4b): the settings / developer menu of the PC port. Hidden by default; a key
// (F1, [gfx] overlay_key = any SDL scancode name) toggles it. ImGui is fed from the nxrt input queue (input.h), not from an
// ImGui platform backend, so it works the same with a window and headless. While it is visible and wants the mouse or the
// keyboard, handle_event() returns true and the game must not see the event. Showing the overlay releases the relative mouse
// mode and hiding it restores it.
// Changes made in the menu that touch the swapchain or the window (present mode, fullscreen) are applied by apply_pending(),
// which the frame loop calls before Renderer::begin_frame().
