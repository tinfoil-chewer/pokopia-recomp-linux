## smo-recomp, ScarletNX and ssbu-recomp (GPL-3.0)

`src/media/movie_mf.cpp` (the `movie::` library on Media Foundation) follows the design of smo-recomp `runtime/services/nnmovie_mf.c` (GPL-3.0): the object layouts of the library, the decoder's two buffer pools, and the token that carries a decoded sample from the extractor to a decoder. The code is rewritten for nxrt (C++, a decode-ahead worker, edit lists, the plain exported wrappers instead of virtual calls).

The nxrt parts that come from smo-recomp and ScarletNX are under GPL-3.0, like nxrt itself (GPL-3.0-or-later). The same holds for the ssbu-recomp references in `include/nxrt/diag.h`, `src/eh/*` (facts read from `runtime/eh_runtime.h` and `runtime/nncxxrt.c`: header layout of the SDK's libc++abi, the non-unique-name bit) and `src/core/hooks.cpp` (idea only). Upstream licence files: smo-recomp `LICENSE` (GPL-3.0), ScarletNX `LICENSE` (GPL-3.0; its source headers say GPL-3.0-or-later), ssbu-recomp `LICENSE` (GPL-3.0). The GPL-3.0 text for nxrt is the `LICENSE` file at the repository root.

## LLVM libc++abi (Apache-2.0 with LLVM exceptions)

`src/eh/typeinfo.cpp`, `src/eh/unwind.cpp`, `include/nxrt/eh.h` and `tests/lift/guest/rt2.h` follow the behaviour and data layouts of LLVM libc++abi (`libcxxabi/src/private_typeinfo.cpp`, `cxa_exception.h`, `cxa_exception.cpp`, `cxa_personality.cpp`), read from the llvm-project repository on 2026-10-21. The code was written from that behaviour and from the Itanium C++ ABI; no libc++abi source text was copied. Licence of the upstream files: Apache License v2.0 with LLVM Exceptions (https://llvm.org/LICENSE.txt), which is compatible with GPL-3.0-or-later for this use. The licence text in the release is `licenses/LICENSE.libcxxabi.Apache-2.0-LLVM-exception.txt` (source: `tools/release/licenses/`).

## recomp `oracle/e2e/rt/eh_rt.cpp` (GPL-3.0-or-later, S1)

`src/eh/unwind.cpp` and `src/eh/catch_call.cpp` rework the table walk and landing protocol of this test-only runtime (S1, same project, same licence). `tests/tools/guest_build.py` and `tests/tools/unicorn_expect.py` import S1's `build_prog.py` and `unicorn_side.py` from `../recomp/oracle/e2e` at build time without copying them.

## libnx (ISC)

`tests/tools/gen_hipc_vectors.py` re-implements the message packing of libnx `sf/hipc.h` and `sf/cmif.h` to produce independent test vectors. libnx is distributed under this licence:

### Vulkan-Headers (Apache-2.0 OR MIT)

Copyright 2015-2026 The Khronos Group Inc. Files fall under Apache-2.0 or MIT (SPDX `Apache-2.0 OR MIT`); nxrt uses them under MIT.

### NVN interface facts

`src/gfx/nvn/nvn_table.inc` and `nvn_sizes.inc` list NVN function names, argument classes and object sizes. They were read from `nvn.h` of the mp1r-practice-mod repository (MIT notice in the file: "Copyright (c) 2020 h1k421"; the repository as a whole is GPL-2.0) and checked against smo-recomp, ssbu-recomp (both GPL-3.0), SuperMarioWonderRecomp (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 BelmanteGu) and LASRecomp (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 Peiikai). No source text is copied into the tables.

### NVN header (MIT) and shader cache module

`src/gfx/nvn/third_party/nvn/nvn.h` is the NVN header of the mp1r-practice-mod repository, copied with its MIT notice ("Copyright (c) 2020 h1k421") and a few corrected typedefs (marked in the file). `src/gfx/nvn/nvn_shaders.h` and `nvn_shaders.cpp` are adapted from SuperMarioWonderRecomp `runtime/src/nvn/nvn_shaders.{h,cpp}` (MIT, Copyright (c) 2026 BelmanteGu; MIT text as above), which in turn follows Ryujinx's `SupportBuffer.cs` (MIT, Copyright Ryujinx Team and Contributors). The translator patches in `tools/shaders` are Ryujinx source in context lines (MIT).

### Tools linked at build time

`nxrt_gfx` links `tools/textures` (astc2bc7, GPL-3.0-or-later; it bundles ARM astcenc 5.7.0, Apache-2.0, loaded as decoder DLLs next to the executable, and bc7e from bc7enc_rdo, Apache-2.0) and `tools/tiling` (GPL-3.0-or-later). Their notices are in those folders.

## yuzu and Eden (GPL-2.0-or-later)

`src/services/fs_romfs.cpp` adapts yuzu's `src/core/file_sys/fsmitm_romfsbuild.cpp`. `src/services/audio_out.cpp` and `src/services/vi_nv.cpp` take layouts from Eden and yuzu, which ScarletNX also ports (ScarletNX is covered above). `src/services/hid_shm.h` follows the Eden HID layout as cross-checked through ScarletNX; its offsets are Ryujinx's (see the Ryujinx section). The upstream licence is GPL-2.0-or-later; Eden's copies of the same files are marked GPL-3.0-or-later. nxrt is GPL-3.0-or-later, and GPL-2.0-or-later code may be used under GPL-3.0. The GPL-2.0 text, with a header naming these files, is `licenses/LICENSE.yuzu-Eden.GPL-2.0.txt` in the release (source: `tools/release/licenses/LICENSE.yuzu-Eden.GPL-2.0.txt`).

## DejaVu fonts (Bitstream Vera licence, reference only)

`src/services/pl.cpp` uses DejaVu Sans (`DejaVuSans.ttf`) as the fallback shared font. The font file is not in this worktree. Its licence text is `assets/fonts/LICENSE-DejaVu.txt` (in the `svc-pl` worktree, with the font at `assets/fonts/DejaVuSans.ttf`), the Bitstream Vera licence as the DejaVu fonts name it. Not copied here.

## AMD FidelityFX SDK v1.1.4, FSR 1 shader headers (MIT)

Files: `third_party/ffx_fsr1/` (`fsr1/ffx_fsr1.h`, `ffx_core*.h`, `ffx_common_types.h` and the other headers listed in `third_party/ffx_fsr1/README.txt`). Copyright (C) 2024 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Licence text: `third_party/ffx_fsr1/LICENSE.txt`. Source: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK, tag v1.1.4. Used by `src/gfx/extras/`: the EASU and RCAS compute shaders are generated from these headers by `scripts/gen_extras_shaders.py`, and the constant setup is a port in `src/gfx/extras/fsr1_consts.cpp`.

## NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK v1.0.3 (MIT)

Files: `third_party/nvidia_nis/` (`NIS_Scaler.h`, `NIS_Config.h`, unmodified). Copyright (c) 2022 NVIDIA CORPORATION & AFFILIATES. Licence text: `third_party/nvidia_nis/LICENSE.txt`. Source: https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/NVIDIAImageScaling, tag v1.0.3. Used by `src/gfx/extras/nis_spatial.cpp` (the constant setup, `NVScalerUpdateConfig`) and by the compute shader in `src/gfx/extras/nis_shaders.inc`, generated from these headers by `scripts/gen_nis_shaders.py`.

## AMD FidelityFX SDK v2.4.0, FidelityFX API headers (MIT)

Files: `third_party/amd_ffx_api/` (`api/include/ffx_api.h`, `ffx_api_types.h`, `ffx_api_loader.h`, `vk/ffx_api_vk.h`, `upscalers/include/ffx_upscale.h`, unmodified). Copyright (c) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Licence text: `third_party/amd_ffx_api/LICENSE.txt`. Source: https://github.com/GPUOpen-LibrariesAndSDKs/FidelityFX-SDK, release v2.4.0. Used by `src/gfx/extras/temporal_ffx.cpp`.

## AMD FidelityFX FSR 3.1 runtime (MIT)

`amd_fidelityfx_loader_vk.dll` and `amd_fidelityfx_upscaler_vk.dll` (AMD-signed, byte-identical to `Kits/FidelityFX/signedbin/` in the FidelityFX SDK v2.4.0 release; the SDK's licence, `licenses/LICENSE.FidelityFX-SDK-v2.4.0.txt` in the release, lists both under MIT) are not in this repository. The release package carries them unchanged in `upscalers/fsr3/`; the game loads them at run time only (`LoadLibrary`), found there, next to the executable or via `[upscale] fsr_dll`.

Source: https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline, release v2.14.16. Used by `src/gfx/extras/temporal_dlss.cpp`; nothing from Streamline is linked.

## NVIDIA Streamline runtime DLLs (MIT)

`sl.interposer.dll`, `sl.common.dll` and `sl.dlss.dll` (NVIDIA-signed, from `bin/x64` of the Streamline SDK v2.14.16 release, https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/Streamline/releases/tag/v2.14.16; MIT, `licenses/LICENSE.Streamline.MIT.txt`, third-party notices in `licenses/NOTICE.Streamline-3rd-party.md`) are not in this repository. The release package carries them unchanged in `upscalers/streamline/`; the game loads them at run time only. Copyright (c) NVIDIA CORPORATION.

## NVIDIA DLSS (nvngx_dlss.dll, not shipped) and Intel XeSS (not shipped)

`nvngx_dlss.dll` (NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution 310.9.16) is under the NVIDIA RTX SDKs LICENSE (v. March 14, 2024; https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS/blob/main/LICENSE.txt, a copy is `licenses/LICENSE.NVIDIA-RTX-SDKs.txt` in the release). That licence requires redistributors to pass on terms at least as protective as its own and forbids any use that subjects the SDK to a licence requiring it to be redistributable at no charge (section 4e), which does not fit a GPL-3.0 package, so neither the repository nor the release package contains the file. The launcher's Game files page offers to download it from NVIDIA's own repository (https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS, tag v310.9.16, sha256 checked) into `upscalers/streamline/` on the player's PC after showing the licence. `libxess.dll` (Intel XeSS) is never shipped either; `xess_dll` is read but not used (see `docs/CONFIG.md`). The DLSS SDK itself (NGX static library) is not used.
